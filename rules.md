# ðŸ”¥ Firestarter Rules
By playing on Firestarter Realms, you agree to the following rules. If you notice that someone is breaking any of the below rules, it is your responsibility to report it to the proper staff. If there are no staff online, use `/report` to send a report which can be handled once staff is available.

### Blacklisted modifications
* Use of [Badlion](https://client.badlion.net/) client, [Lunar](https://www.lunarclient.com/) client, [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net/home), and some mods such as [VoxelMap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/voxelmap), [Xaero's Minimap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap), and [JourneyMap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/journeymap) (along with other minimap mods that do not disclose underground blocks) is allowed.
* Use of utility clients is bannable (no [Wurst](https://www.wurstclient.net/), [Aristois](https://aristois.net/), etc).
* Some mods, such as [Tweakaroo](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tweakeroo), are bannable if used on the server.

### Toxic behavior
* Treat everyone with respect.
* Any kind of sexual harassment in public and private chat is bannable.
* Do not bully anyone.
* Cursing is allowed, so long as it is not directed towards any particular person or figure.

### Griefing
* Griefing obviously inhabited but unclaimed land is bannable.
* Raiding unclaimed containers (chests, barrels, anything that stores items) is alright, so long as they are not shop chests.
* Breaking blocks that you did not place, even in unclaimed lands, is bannable. This includes spawners that are not naturally generated. This also includes killing animals you didn't breed and breaking crops in a farm that you didn't create. If the farm is public, you must replant after harvesting.
* If a player is offline for 3 or more months, you may ask an admin to unclaim one or more of their claims and you will be able to reclaim it. Right-click with a stick on the claimed area to check the age of the claim. Once the claim is yours, you are free to build, edit, or take items. If you lack the claimblocks to reclaim, you will be denied access to the claim until you are capable of claiming it. If another user comes along with enough claimblocks after you had already asked but lacked the claimblocks, the user with the ability to reclaim will be given it. You are free to unclaim these claims at any time.
* It is your responsibility to claim your builds. If your builds are griefed, the griefer will be punished and you are eligible for a [rollback](rollbacks.md).
* Creating lava casts, also frequently referred to as "cobble monsters," counts as griefing and is bannable.
* Creating teleport traps, including those intended to kill players, is bannable.
  
### Scamming
* Offering to sell a specific item and instead selling another after a transaction has been made is bannable.
* Selling deceptive shulkers, i.e. shulkers that display the name of a desirable item in the lore but are instead renamed items of a different type, falls under scamming.
* Logging off after a trade agreement has been made falls under scamming.

### Auction House
* Selling renamed items on auction with the purpose of advertising warps, trades and services is not allowed.

### Stealing
* Betrayal of trust on claims falls under this category and will result in a ban.
* Stealing from shop chests you have access to is bannable.

### Copyright
* Selling a map you did not create is plagiarism and is bannable.

### Claims
* Claims must be at least 200 blocks of one another. Resizing a claim towards the direction of another claim may be bannable under this rule.
* As a mayor, caught stealing from users who reside in one of your subdivided claims is bannable.
* Setting a home or warp in another players claim without permission of the claim owner is not allowed. 
* Leaving pets in claims where you do not have trust is not allowed.

### Chat, spam, and advertising
* It is okay to mention well-known servers and services in the chat, but advertising a private or malicious server or service is bannable.
* Chat spam of any kind, including command spam and splitting a word in multiple smaller messages, is bannable.
* It is not okay to discuss politics in public chat. By extension, it is also not okay to disrespect others based on their political or religious views.
* Use only English in main chat. You are allowed to use other languages in private messages, such as /msg or party chat.
* Excessive use of capitalization is not allowed. Repeated offenses will result in a (temporary) mute. 
* Announcing that a staff member is vanished is not allowed. 

### Racism, offensive language, and discrimination
* Do not use racist, offensive, or discriminatory language in chat, on signs, in books, in item names, private messages, or anywhere on the server that accepts text.
* This includes the use of the n-word, hate symbols, or hate speech.
* We are strict about this and will permanently ban if this occurs.

### Exploiting server issues
* If you discover a server bug, **do not** exploit it for your own gain. Report this issue directly to an administrator.
* Irresponsible disclosure of bugs, such as in public chat or the Discord server, will result in a permanent ban.

### Spreading misinformation/defamation
* Intentionally spreading misinformation to hurt the image of the server or any of its staff or players is strictly bannable.
* Defamation will not be tolerated.
* Issuing false player reports is bannable.

### Alternate account usage (Alts)
* Using alternate accounts to claim extra event rewards is bannable.

### Threats
* Threatening to damage any part of the server, including its players, is strictly prohibited and will result in a ban.
* Threatening to ruin the economy or attack the server, i.e. DDoS attack, is bannable.
* Encouraging other players to break the rules is bannable.
* Building lag machines or machines that are intentionally created to degrade the server performance count as an attack.
  
### Drama and discussing punishments 
* Starting drama or encouraging others to start drama on the server is strictly bannable.
* If you have a question about someone's ban or punishment, feel free to **privately** message a staff member about it. Do not take it to general chat. Bans are public and posted [here](https://bans.firestartermc.com/bans.php).

### Inappropriate skins and names
* Any skin or username that is deemed inappropriate by the staff will result in a ban until it is changed. 
* This also goes for item names in-game.

### Scope of moderation
* Staff have final say when it comes to punishments and moderation. Listen to what they tell you.
* We do **not** moderate anything that takes place outside of the bounds of our server. We only moderate actions on the Firestarter Realms or within the Firestarter Discord server. Anything outside of that is out of our scope of moderation, and you are responsible for moderating yourself.
* As soon as a conversation moves to private messages outside of the server (DMs), we cannot moderate what happens. If the conversation is between a player and Firestarter Staff, any threats or messages intended to harm may result in punishment. This is for both the staff member and the player.
* The job of moderators is to moderate and enforce the rules. They are not necessarily here to help you with gameplay, such as assisting with your builds. Do not waste their time.

### Store purchases
* All store purchases are final. Chargebacks will result in a permanent ban.
* We do not offer refunds on purchases made unless you do not receive the advertised goods.

### Disclaimer
* Firestarter ("us", "we", or "our") reserves the right to change these Rules at any time, at its sole discretion, without notice. Any change binds you as soon as you access the https://firestartermc.com (the "Site"), https://store.firestartermc.com (the "Store"), the Firestarter Minecraft Realms (the "Server"), and the Firestarter Discord server (the "Discord Server"). We therefore strongly recommend checking the Rules on a regular basis.
