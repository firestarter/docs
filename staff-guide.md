Check via [Coreprotect](https://www.minerealm.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=6781) which player broke or placed which block, use this to get information about potential Griefs that are reported but happened in the past.

Make sure you have the evidence before you ban a player that is using a Modified client. Should the player be ruining the others experience by chat you can punish them before getting evidence since it will stay accessible.

Is a player annoying someone with for example agressive pets or is building outside of anothers claim without their permission and they don't react on warnings, you can use `/spawn <username>` to force teleport them to spawn, Run this command twice to avoid them being able to return with `/back`. Make sure this is the case before using the command.

Should you see another staff member potentially break a rule, contact them personally or an admin, do not act on your own against other staff.

If you need clarification on any of these, please either post in `#staff-chat` or contact an admin. After you have given out a punishment, please post evidence of the offense in the `#evidence` channel on our Discord server. This will help us keep track of punishments in case we need the evidence in the future.
